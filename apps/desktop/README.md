# DeepSeek Harness Desktop

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The desktop app supervises the existing loopback Web Host and keeps it alive from the system tray when its window is closed.

## Development

Install dependencies, then use the single desktop development command. It builds the Host and client packages, Web frontend, and Electron main process before launching the application:

```sh
pnpm run dev:desktop
```

Closing the window hides it. Use the tray menu to restore the window or quit the application. Explicit quit waits for the Host process to stop and escalates termination after the bounded Host grace period.

The tray menu rebuilds with Host state: it shows the backend status (starting/running/reconnecting/stopped), manually restarts the backend, shows and switches the Host working directory (the last choice persists in the application data directory and is restored on the next launch, falling back to the platform default when the saved path no longer exists), opens the current Host in the system browser, opens the log directory, and toggles launch at login. An unexpected Host exit restarts it with exponential backoff (1s base, 30s cap); a successful recovery resets the backoff. The last bound loopback port persists in the application data directory and is preferred on restart — when the port is unchanged, the Web UI's connection generation rebuilds both WebSocket downlinks and re-runs the `host.describe` handshake without a full reload. The global shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+D` reveals the main window. Host output is written to `host.log` in the application data directory (reset per application run, trailing window kept past the cap) and mirrored to the application stderr. Packaged builds restore toolchain PATH entries (Homebrew and others) that GUI launches omit. The Host starts in its own POSIX process group so shutdown terminates tool subprocesses with it.

The desktop app accepts only the readiness URL emitted by `dsh web` for `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. Navigation stays on that origin; HTTP and HTTPS links open in the system browser.

Native chrome follows the host platform. macOS uses a frameless inset title bar, traffic lights, and sidebar vibrancy; its collapsed sidebar is 90px wide, with centered controls whose top edge aligns with the expanded logo row below the traffic lights. Windows retains its system frame, shadow, resize and Snap behavior, and Windows 11 rounded corners while a hidden title bar places the native caption buttons in the Session header's first row; the Windows sidebar has no traffic-light inset. The empty part of that row remains draggable, its controls remain clickable, and a resident drag band covers the same row when no Session header is visible. Windows acrylic and macOS vibrancy reach only the sidebar, while conversation and details stay opaque. Linux keeps a frameless window and an opaque sidebar fallback.

## Packaging

The local packaging command performs the complete repository build, stages the Host's closed production dependency tree, and creates an unpacked application for the current platform. A separate manual build is not required:

```sh
pnpm run package:desktop
```

Packaged applications run the staged `@deepseek-ai/dsh` CLI in a separate process through Electron's Node mode. The application therefore retains the supervised-Host lifecycle without shipping a second Node executable. An `afterPack` check rejects the package before signing when the staged CLI entry or Web frontend entry is absent. Both macOS and Windows use the exact tracked `apps/desktop/build/icon.png` source; the repository does not preprocess or commit platform-specific icon variants.

### Signed macOS DMG

The macOS distribution command requires a valid `Developer ID Application` identity whose certificate and private key are both installed in the build user's Keychain. It also requires one complete notarization credential source. A Keychain profile keeps the app-specific password out of the repository and shell history:

```sh
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "dsh-notary" --apple-id "<Apple ID>" --team-id "<Team ID>"
```

`notarytool` requests the secret interactively. Build the signed, hardened-runtime, notarized DMG with the stored profile:

```sh
APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=dsh-notary pnpm run dist:mac:desktop
```

An existing secrets file can supply `MAC_CERT_P12_BASE64`, `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` without importing the certificate into the persistent Keychain:

```sh
node --env-file=/absolute/path/to/macos-signing-secrets.env --import tsx apps/desktop/scripts/release-mac.ts
```

Electron Builder imports that Base64 PKCS#12 certificate into its temporary Keychain and removes it when the build finishes. The wrapper keeps signing and notarization variables out of the repository-build and runtime-staging subprocesses, then passes them only to Electron Builder. The secrets file and its path are never tracked.

The release preflight runs before the repository build. It fails if the host is not macOS, the supplied identity is not a `Developer ID Application` identity, signing credentials are incomplete, signing discovery is disabled, or notarization credentials are missing or incomplete. Without the PKCS#12 group, it requires a usable `Developer ID Application` identity and private key in the Keychain. Instead of a Keychain profile, the command accepts the complete Apple ID group (`APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`) or App Store Connect API key group (`APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`, and `APPLE_API_ISSUER`).

After a successful build, mount the generated DMG and verify the installed application signature, Gatekeeper assessment, and stapled notarization ticket:

```sh
DMG_PATH="$(find apps/desktop/dist -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.dmg' -print -quit)"
MOUNT_POINT="$(mktemp -d)"
hdiutil attach "$DMG_PATH" -mountpoint "$MOUNT_POINT" -nobrowse -readonly
APP_PATH="$MOUNT_POINT/DeepSeek Harness.app"
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 "$APP_PATH"
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 "$APP_PATH"
xcrun stapler validate "$APP_PATH"
hdiutil detach "$MOUNT_POINT"
rmdir "$MOUNT_POINT"
```

## Known limitations

The first desktop assembly uses a loopback HTTP Host. The renderer and Host protocol remain unchanged so the application can replace the transport with the IPC carrier reserved by the GUI architecture without changing product features.

The signed installer path currently targets macOS. Windows and Linux packaging creates unpacked applications; their installer formats and distribution signing remain release work.

## Model Experience

The desktop shell does not add model-visible input. The reused Web profile continues to own its existing Web runtime context.
